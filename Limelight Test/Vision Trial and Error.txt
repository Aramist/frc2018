Vision testing for autonomously driving to boxes.

At the beginning, the robot had a base speed of 0.1 (ControlMode.PercentOutput), which was too slow. This was later increased
to 0.3 and then 0.4.

At one point the robot began to successfully grab the box in 4 out of 5 tests, however, when the box was moved, it became
apparent that the results of the vision system were highly dependent on the ambient lighting.

It is currently (2/1/2018 17:00) unknown whether the problem with lighting adaptability has been solved with the tweaks made
to the vision system, but it now successfully grabs the cube in every test when the cube's center is within the robot's FOV of
+-30 degrees. The next goal is to create a Command that will have the robot turn around to look for targets (power cubes) if it
does not see any in its immediate field of view.

As of now (2/1/2018 17:21) the robot is now capable of turning around (+- 30 degrees from starting heading) to search for targets in
its surroundings.
